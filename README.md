# Course App

This is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for managing and viewing courses. The application allows users to list, filter, and view courses through a video player. Additionally, users can add new courses to the platform. The Material-UI (MUI) library is used for styling the application.

## Features
* Course Listing: View all available courses.
* Filtering: Filter courses based on specific criteria.
* Video Player: Watch course videos directly in the application.
* Add Courses: Users can add new courses to the platform.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Material-UI (MUI): A React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
### Backend
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
### Database
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing courses and user data.
